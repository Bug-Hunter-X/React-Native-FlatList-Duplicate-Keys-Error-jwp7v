This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items with a unique key prop that's not actually unique.  This often happens when you're relying on an index as the key, or if your data source contains duplicate keys.  React Native will throw a warning in the console, but the app may also behave unexpectedly, leading to issues like incorrect rendering, missed updates, or performance problems.  The warning itself looks something like this: `Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. See https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html for more information.`
