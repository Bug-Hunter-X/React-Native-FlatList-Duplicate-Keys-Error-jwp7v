Instead of using the index as a key (which is almost always wrong), always use a unique identifier from your data source as the key for each item in your FlatList. This identifier should be unique across all items in the data source. For example, if your data is an array of objects, each object should have a unique ID property (e.g., a database ID). Here's how to fix the code:

```javascript
// FlatListBugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { FlatList, Text, View } from 'react-native';

const data = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: '3', name: 'Item 3' },
];

const MyFlatList = () => {
  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data}
      keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
    />
  );
};

export default MyFlatList;
```
The `keyExtractor` prop now correctly uses the unique `id` property from each item as the key.  This ensures that React Native can efficiently update and render the list correctly, even when the data changes.
