This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: the use of non-unique keys. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, resulting in a warning about duplicate keys and potentially incorrect rendering.  The solution, provided in `FlatListBugSolution.js`, shows how to correctly implement unique keys using a unique identifier from your data source, fixing the rendering issues and preventing the warning.
